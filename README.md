### Getting Started

These instructions will guide you in how to install and run application, as well as how to run unit tests
Prerequisites.

The aim of this application is to make everything happen by only using Vanilla JS and this is the why I am not using any other framework or library.

### Notes

* Jest unit test are just for sample. They will be enriched.
* **Feel free to make any comments concerning the code. I want to become better!**

### Upcoming tasks
* Improve UI
* UI more responsive
* Improve "expand to show more details" functionality
* Do some more refactor to make code reusable in cases like MovieApiService
* Using redux store
* Add environmental files to load configuration for different instances
* Make NavigationBarComponent more dynamic
