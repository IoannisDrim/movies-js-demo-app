# Movie Rama

**Movie Rama** is a demo application designed to showcase my skills in modern web development. This project is still under implementation, but it provides a first impression of the technologies and techniques I use.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this application is to demonstrate my proficiency in:

- JavaScript
- Webpack
- Babel
- ESLint
- Jest
- CSS/Sass
- HTML
- Vercel deployment

This project is intentionally built using only JavaScript to demonstrate strong proficiency with the language. The goal is to show that understanding JavaScript is fundamental, as all modern frameworks are built on top of it.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel, providing a seamless and efficient way to showcase the demo. You can access the live version of the app [here](https://movies-js-demo-app.vercel.app/).

## Status

This project is currently under development. While it is not yet complete, you can explore the existing features and get a sense of the overall direction and quality of the application.

Feel free to explore the codebase and provide any feedback or suggestions.

## Unit Tests

Basic unit tests have been added using Jest for the sake of presentation. The goal is not to test everything but to demonstrate some use cases and show how testing can be integrated into the project.
